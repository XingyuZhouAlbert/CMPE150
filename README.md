CMPE150: Introduction to Computer Networking
Taken in Winter 2019 with Professor Christina Parsa.

This class taught the basics of networking, such as packet switching and making a network topology. We used Wireshark to help analyze the packets. 

Each different assignment folder has the PDF for the lab requirements, as well as the various files for each folder.
